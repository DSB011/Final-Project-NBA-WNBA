            <p>At the NBA, we’re passionate about growing and celebrating the game of basketball. Through the intensity of the game and the amazing athletic skill of our players, 
                we deliver excitement to hundreds of millions of fans around the world.
                As a global sports and media business, the NBA is so much more. While Basketball Operations runs the league’s on-court activities, 
                other departments manage relationships with television and digital media partners, develop marketing partnerships with some of the world’s most recognizable companies, oversee the licensing of NBA merchandise, 
                and handle a wide range of responsibilities that drive the NBA’s success.
                Off the court, we’re also deeply committed to social responsibility. NBA Cares leads the league’s involvement in addressing important social issues by working with internationally recognized youth-serving organizations 
                that support education, youth and family development, and health-related causes.</p>
                
                <p> The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) is a professional basketball league in the United States. It is currently composed of twelve teams. The league was founded on April 22, 1996, as the women's "counterpart" 
                    to the National Basketball Association (NBA), and league play started in 1997. The WNBA is known to be the most competitive basketball league in the world.</p>
